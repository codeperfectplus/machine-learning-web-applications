# Context

The data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Content

Title: Auto-Mpg Data

## Sources

- (a) Origin: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is
maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was
used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
(c) Date: July 7, 1993

Past Usage:

- See 2b (above)
Quinlan,R. (1993). Combining Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning.

Learning, 236-243, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Morgan

Relevant Information:

- This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in
the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in
predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed
because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original
dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

- "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon,
to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous
attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

Number of Instances: 398

Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute

## Attribute Information

- mpg: continuous
- cylinders: multi-valued discrete
- displacement: continuous
- horsepower: continuous
- weight: continuous
- acceleration: continuous
- model year: multi-valued discrete
- origin: multi-valued discrete
- car name: string (unique for each instance)
- Missing Attribute Values: horsepower has 6 missing values
